 * Cookie Monster
 *
 * Read the value of the a capacitive sensor between pins 4 and 5 and 
 * turn on a ultra-bright LED to light up the scene as well as send
 * a character "p" (as in "picture") over serial when detecting the 
 * value on the touch sensor went over a threshold.
 *
 * We place a 1M resistor between pins 4 and 5 and use pin 5 as touchpad.
 * Pin 7 is connected to the ultra-bright white LED.
 *
 * You will have to configure the value of the THRESHOLD constant for the
 * program to operate properly. Follow these steps:
 *
 * 1) connect your circuit to the aluminium folie
 * 2) measure the default value, depending on how much folie you have this 
 *    value could be in the range of 200
 * 3) touch the sensitive area and observe the measurement in the Serial Monitor
 * 4) make THRESHOLD = (MAX_VALUE + DEFAULT_VALUE) / 2 and change it in the code
